# Coffee-Machine-Using-OOP
This project simulates a virtual coffee machine built using Python and the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows users to select drinks, checks resource availability, processes coins, and serves coffee — all through a command-line interface.
# ☕ Coffee Machine Project

This is a Python-based coffee machine simulation that uses **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** to model real-world behavior. The project mimics a coffee vending machine where users can choose drinks, insert coins, and receive change.

## 💡 Features
- Menu of drinks (espresso, latte, cappuccino)
- Tracks resources like water, milk, and coffee
- Accepts coins and calculates balance
- Uses classes and methods to organize code
- Command-line interaction for a smooth user experience

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- CLI-based interface

## 🎓 Learning Outcome
This project helped me understand:
- How classes and objects work in Python
- Real-life application of OOP concepts
- Structuring code for better readability and modularity
